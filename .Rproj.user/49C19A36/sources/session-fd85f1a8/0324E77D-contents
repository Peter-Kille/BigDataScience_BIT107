# My HPC System

All HPC are slightly different and it is important to understand the specific system you are using. The current activities cover relate to the IT infrastructure provided to Big Data Masters student at Cardiff University session 2022-23. If you are not part of this class then you will need to request appropriate information about the system you have been given access to.

## House Keeping

### login to the server

HPC system available to big data masters students:

host

```{bash}
gomphus.bios.cf.ac.uk
```

User name `university username` Password `SSO Password` Port `22`

We suggest you use (MobaXterm)\[<https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/>\] (PC) and terminal SSH (Mac) to access the server and MobaXtrem and (cyberduck)\[<https://cyberduck.io/>\] or (filezilla)\[<https://filezilla-project.org/>\] to allow secure file transfer (sftp) between server and local computer resources.

### create 'symlinks' to classdata and my data

Linux `ln` command allows you to create a symbolic link (also symlink or soft link) to a file or directory (called the "target") by specifying a path thereto. The format is `ln -s [target location] [shortcut]`. I recommend you create the following symlinks at your root position.

```{bash}
ln -s /mnt/clusters/sponsa/data/classdata classdata

ln -s /mnt/clusters/sponsa/data/${USER} mydata

mkdir /mnt/scratch/${USER}

ln -s /mnt/scratch/${USER} scratch
```
:::

You should now see two sym links at you root `classdata` and `mydata` that will allow you to address these locations using:

```         
~/classdata/
~/mydata/
```

## Explore your HPC resources

### Your disc quota

::: {.greeting .message style="color: red;"}
Review what 'storage' resources are available to you.

```         
quota -us [username]
```
:::

This should display the following information:

Disk quotas for user smbpk (uid 31961):

### HPC resources

The head node on gomphus is a 16 cpu / 32 Gb RAM server.....but it provides access to a series of servers.

::: {.greeting .message style="color: red;"}
Node Availability

The head node has a specific script that displays the resources available to you. Run the command:

```         
gomphus.node_availability.sh

# Job Schedulers and Slurm

## The Slurm Job Scheduler

The slurm job scheduler is software that controls and monitors access to high-performance computing hardware. It allocates resources (cpus/cores/RAM) on a per-job basis.

## Slurm Partitions (Queues)

A number of slurm partitions (queues) may exist on any slurm cluster, and each queue will suit certain types of jobs. Each of the separate queues will handle jobs slightly differently, or will have varying resources available to it. Below is a list of queues available on our HPC systems, and the typical types of jobs they accommodate.

**Gomphus Queues**

| partition(queue) name | default? | description                         |     |
|-----------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|-----|
| defq                  | ✔        | batch jobs, low mem/cpu requirement |     |

## Submitting Jobs (The Slurm Job-Script)

The typical method to start a job on a slurm cluster is to first create a job-script, then submit that job-script to the slurm queue using the sbatch command. The job-script is laid out in a certain way (examples below), which will first request resources on the compute nodes, and then define the individual steps of your job. Below is an example job script for gomphus slurm using the partition defq. We'll name the job-script `submit.sh`:

```{bash}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=defq       # the requested queue
#SBATCH --nodes=1              # number of nodes to use
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=1     #
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1      #   
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000     # in megabytes, unless unit explicitly stated
#SBATCH --error=%J.err         # redirect stderr to this file
#SBATCH --output=%J.out        # redirect stdout to this file
##SBATCH --mail-user=[insert email address]@Cardiff.ac.uk  # email address used for event notification
##SBATCH --mail-type=end                                   # email on job end
##SBATCH --mail-type=fail                                  # email on job failure

echo "Some Usable Environment Variables:"
echo "================================="
echo "hostname=$(hostname)"
echo \$SLURM_JOB_ID=${SLURM_JOB_ID}
echo \$SLURM_NTASKS=${SLURM_NTASKS}
echo \$SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE=${SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE}
echo \$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK=${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK}
echo \$SLURM_JOB_CPUS_PER_NODE=${SLURM_JOB_CPUS_PER_NODE}
echo \$SLURM_MEM_PER_CPU=${SLURM_MEM_PER_CPU}

# Write jobscript to output file (good for reproducibility)
cat $0
```

The job can be submitted from the head node of the slurm cluster using the command:

```         
sbatch submit.sh
```

This particular job does nothing interesting except print out some useful job-specific slurm environment variables, which you may utilise in your job-scripts.

This job-script is actually just a simple bash script, and in bash the \# character will comment out the remaining text on that line, and will not be parsed by the bash interpreter. In a slurm job-script however, the lines starting with #SBATCH is parsed by slurm before the script is handed over to the bash interpreter. The #SBATCH lines will inform the slurm scheduler of the amount of resources requested for the job.

If you would like to comment out certain slurm commands in your job-script, simply add an extra \# at the beginning of the #SBATCH lines (as we have done in the above example for all email-related commands).

Some further useful (but not exhaustive) SBATCH options are detailed:

| SBATCH option     | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| --ntasks-per-node | allocate n tasks per allocated node.                                                                                                                            |
| --nodes           | set the number of nodes that the job will require. Each node will have --ntasks-per-node processes started                                                      |
| --ntasks          | spawn n tasks (default=1). This determines how many processes will be spawned (for MPI jobs).                                                                   |
| --cpus-per-task   | allocate n CPUs per task. This option is needed for multi-threaded jobs. Typically n should be equal to the number of threads your program spawns.              |
| --partition       | select the partition (queue) where you want to execute your job. Depending on the HPC system you are using, there may, or may not, be much choice.              |
| --mem-per-cpu     | specify the the memory needed per allocated CPU in MB.                                                                                                          |
| --job-name        | name your job. This name will be shown in the queue status and email alerts. It is also important for job chaining.                                             |
| --output          | specify a filename that will be used to store the stdout of your job. The slurm variable %J is useful here which slurm will interpret as the job_id of the job. |
| --error           | similar to the --output option, but redirect your job's stderr.                                                                                                 |

### Resource Limitations

On the a slurm cluster, the slurm scheduler keeps track of both requested CPUs, and memory. If your job exceeds the currently available resources then your job will be queued until sufficient resources are available. If your job exceeds the total amount of resources available on the compute nodes then your job submission will fail and will not be queued, in which case an error will be returned.

## My first slurm Job - Excersise

To submit an appropriately configured job-script to the slurm queue, use the command:

```{bash}
sbatch submit.sh
```

Use `cat` or `less` to rReview the content of the `.out` and `.err` files - note the `.out` file should contain a summary of the varibles used by the script and the program you ran.

The gomphus cluster has a number of example job-scripts (located under `~/classdata/REFS/slurm` on the gompus.bios.cf.ac.uk server). You may submit these jobs with the following commands on the gomphus cluster:

```{bash}
# first cd to your allocated ~/mydata/ folder.
mkdir -p test_jobs && cd test_jobs
cp ~/classdata/REFS/slurm/slurm_examples/example1/* .
sbatch example1.sh
```

What is the function of this example script ??
:::

## Loading programs in slurm scripts

Review what programs are available too you using

```{bash}
module avail
```

Programs should be loaded using 'module load' after the slurm parameters have been defined and before you define variable or provide commands for you program.

## Viewing Information About a Job

### Information on Running Jobs

If your job-script used the srun command to kick off a (parallel) process, then slurm will be able to provide live information about your running job. All information about your running job can be listed with the sstat command:

```{bash}
sstat -l -j [jobid]
```

In particular it may be useful to compare the fields MaxRSS and ReqMem. These fields report the actual max memory of a single task, and the requested memory of a single task, respectively. You may then tune any future job-scripts to more accurately represent your jobs, which will lead to better queue efficiency - meaning your job will likely start sooner.

If any application call within your job-script did not use the srun command, then no live information will be available. Instead, wait for your job to finish and use the sacct command, as described below.

### Information on Completed Jobs

Similar to the `sstat` command used for running jobs, the sacct command will provide equivalent information about completed jobs.

## Useful Slurm-Related Commands

The sinfo command can supply a lot of useful information about the nodes and available resources. A useful set of parameters of which to call sinfo with is the following:

```{bash}
sinfo -o "%24N %.5D %9P %11T %.4c %.8z %.8m %.8d %.6w %8f %15C %20E"
NODELIST                 NODES PARTITION STATE       CPUS    S:C:T   MEMORY TMP_DISK WEIGHT AVAIL_FE CPUS(A/I/O/T)   REASON              
gomphus[1-4]                 4 defq*     idle          32   1:32:1    62250        0      1 (null)   0/128/0/128     none 
```

Here, we see a list of nodes on the gomphus cluster (grouped by partition, and by state), and information about the nodes. In this particular instance we see that gomphus has 4 nodes \[1-4\] each with 32 CPUS. The CPUS(A/I/O/T) column shows that the defq partition has a total of 0 CPUs Allocated, 128 CPUs Idle, 0 in state Other, making a Total of 128 (all 4 nodes combined).

The above command is a bit of a handful. You have already used the wrapper script created for you `gomphus.job_history.sh`

### other useful commands

To cancel a running job:

```{bash}
$ scancel [jobid]
```

information about the compute nodes:

```{bash}
$ sinfo -lNe
```

List the current status of the slurm queue:

```{bash}
$ squeue
```

Find information on previously completed jobs:

```{bash}
$ sacct
```

List information on running jobs:

```{bash}
$ sstat
```

## Constructing a slurm Job - good practice

Adapt RNAseq processing script 1-QC.sh (see session Session5 -RNAseq-Processing) to run under slurm (do not run script 2 -- building genome) \*\* if you find this easy try adapting script 3,4 and 5.

You may want to discuss the resources required for the job.

Hints:

define directories using full path derived with `PWD -P`

```{bash}
~/mydata/ = /mnt/clusters/sponsa/data/$USER/
```

When creating composite variables use enclose them in quotation marks to ensure they expand.

```{bash}
"${indir}/fastq/${i}_1.fastq"
```
:::

## Interactive Jobs

Enter an interactive job and use this to review the files created by the RNAseq processing scripts.

```{bash}
##Use any available node
srun -c 4 --mem=8G -p defq --pty bash

##use a specific node - in this example called gomphus3

srun -c 4 --mem=8G -p defq --nodelist=gomphus3 --pty bash
```

Remember to exit the interactive job when you are finished by typing `exit`

***Advanced:*** Some HPC architectures will allow you to directly write to the 'local' harddrive `/tmp` For jobs with lots of I/O and where the nodes are using new M2 SSD drives this can accelerate certain types of jobs.

## blast as an example

We take a closer look at running jobs on our cluster, we should provide examples of benchmarking code in order to find how to best utilise the resources available.

We start off by benchmarking a simple blast job, initially running over a single core, then parallelizing the job using blast's built-in threading. All jobs are run on a single node, and we test a number of nodes and compare results. For example source code, see the folder `~/classdata/REFS/slurm/slurm_examples/indepth_parallelizing_blastp` on the gomphus server.

Remember to run all commands in your `~/mydata/[directory]`.

First we obtain the sample data:

```{bash}
# this is already downloaded to ~/classdata/REFS/slurm/slurm_examples/indepth_parallelizing_blastp/
curl -L -o TAIR10_pep.fasta  https://www.arabidopsis.org/download_files/Proteins/TAIR10_protein_lists/TAIR10_pep_20101214

## we can prepare the data within a interactive job
srun -c 4 --mem=8G -p defq --pty bash

## navigate to mydata directory
cd ~/mydata/

## make a dirctory for blast test
mkdir -p blast_test && cd blast_test 

## copy TAIR file accross from class data to local file system
cp /mnt/clusters/sponsa/data/classdata/Bioinformatics/REFS/slurm/slurm_examples/indepth_parallelizing_blastp/run2_split-files4/TAIR10_pep.fasta .

## Makeblast db from downloaded file
module load blast/2.12.0
makeblastdb -in TAIR10_pep.fasta -parse_seqids -dbtype prot -title "Small protein database" -out TAIR10_pep

##copy the query sub-set
cp /mnt/clusters/sponsa/data/classdata/Bioinformatics/REFS/slurm/slurm_examples/indepth_parallelizing_blastp/TAIR10_pep_4000.fasta .

exit
```

Now create the job Script - blastp.sh

```{bash}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=defq       # the requested queue
#SBATCH --nodes=1              # number of nodes to use
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=1     #

# Threads, MPI and embarrassingly parallel

## Parallel Jobs

There are a number of different scenarios in which you may want to parallelize your job:

-   Embarrassingly parallel
-   MPI - a multi-process application (possibly across multiple compute hosts)
-   multi-threading - shared memory using OpenMP or perhaps pthreads.
-   multiple instances of a single application.
-   ...plus more scenarios but are probably out of scope of this tutorial.

## Embarrassingly parallel

Many processes in genomics do the same task on large arrays of data. One of the simplest way of speeding up the process is to split up the input files and perfrom the same task multiple times at the same time - this is called an \_**'Embarrassingly parallel'** task.

Lets do this for the blast example that we started in the last task. We can investigate whether there are any further methods of improving performance, and attempt to find a improvemet in the initial blast job's solution to reduce the time taken. As it turns out, it is possible in this situation to split the input fasta file into a number of sections, and have an independent job acting on each of those sections. Each independent job could then be parallelized, say over 8 threads, and all jobs can run concurrently.

We create a job script (mammoth_8thread_split_1of4.sh) that will run blast command on the first file-section only.

We perform the following sequence of commands, first splitting the input fasta file into 4 parts, then creating the 4 independent job-scripts, and submit the jobs.

```{bash}
## enter a interactive Job
srun -c 4 --mem=8G -p defq --pty bash
cd ~/mydata/blast_test/

## a new folder
mkdir split-files4
cd split-files4/
cp ~/TAIR10_pep_4000.fasta  .
#
## split the fasta file into 4 equal(ish) sections
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmarnellos/Trinotate_example_supplement/master/split_fasta.pl | perl /dev/stdin  TAIR10_pep_4000.fasta  TAIR10_pep.vol 1000
```

create script that will spawn blast_jobs (use nano or vi) - spawn_blastp.sh

```{bash}
!#/bin/bash

for i in {1..4};do

export i

sbatch blastp.sh

done
```

make script executable `chmod +x spawn_blastp.sh`

Edit blast job so that each time it is called it uses a different section of the query file

```{bash}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=defq       # the requested queue
#SBATCH --nodes=1              # number of nodes to use
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=1     #

##SBATCH --mail-type=end                                   # email on job end

Perform file-splitting procedure for both a 2-split and a 4-split of the original fasta file. The 'time-to-solution' results are added to the original benchmark chart. We assume that all jobs run concurrently, and we take the wall-time for the longest job

## MPI Jobs

Our example MPI job is based on a quantum espresso calculation. This script utilises the srun command, which is part of the slurm family of tools to run a parallel job on a cluster

```{bash}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=mammoth    # the requested queue
#SBATCH --job-name=qe_mpi      # name the job           
#SBATCH --nodes=1              # number of nodes to use
#SBATCH --ntasks=32            # total number of tasks (processes)
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=100      # in megabytes, unless unit explicitly stated
#SBATCH --error=%J.err         # redirect stderr to this file
#SBATCH --output=%J.out        # redirect stdout to this file
##SBATCH --mail-user=[insert email address]@Cardiff.ac.uk  # email address used for event notification
##SBATCH --mail-type=end                                   # email on job end
##SBATCH --mail-type=fail                                  # email on job failure

# Some of these environment variables are utilised by the qe executable itself
export ESPRESSO_DATAPATH=/mnt/clusters/sponsa/data/classdata/Bioinformatics/REFS/slurm/slurm_examples/example2_mpi/
export ESPRESSO_PSEUDO=${ESPRESSO_DATAPATH}
export ESPRESSO_TMPDIR=${ESPRESSO_DATAPATH}/${SLURM_JOB_ID}

# handy to place this in job output for future reference...
cat ${ESPRESSO_DATAPATH}/atom.in

# execute the parallel job (we also time it)
time srun -n ${SLURM_NTASKS} pw.x < ${ESPRESSO_DATAPATH}/atom.in > atom.job${SLURM_JOB_ID}.out
```

The job requests 32 cores to be allocated, and runs the srun command with the argument -n \${SLURM_NTASKS} which tells srun to spawn the mpi-job with the total number of processes requested. Quantum Espresso utilises the environment variable ESPRESSO_TMPDIR which points to a temporary folder. We design this in our slurm script to point to a subfolder.

An alternative storage location is the compute node's local storage. This can improve runtime I/O performance. However, local storage on the compute nodes is limited (Gigabytes not Terabytes), and it's availability is a little hidden from the user, so take care not to fill up the disk(!) and remove all files from the compute node's local storage within the job script (your only access to the compute node's /local folder is via the slurm script). An alternative job script which utilises a compute node's /local storage is provided on the gomphus server /mnt/clusters/sponsa/data/classdata/Bioinformatics/REFS/slurm/slurm_examples/example2_mpi/example2_mpi_localstorage.sh.

## Threaded Jobs

A number of popular bioinformatics software are capable of parallelising execution using threads (usually OpenMP or pthreads). This parallelisation method does not normally use distributed memory, so the application will need to be run on a single node. Our threaded example slurm-script is based on BLAST+. The job script is listed:

```{bash}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=defq
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2000
#SBATCH --error=%J.err
#SBATCH --output=%J.out
##SBATCH --mail-type=end
##SBATCH --mail-user=[your.email@address]


# Example slurm script
#  This script is a little wasteful of resources,
#  but demonstrates a simple pipeline.
#  
#  For a more efficient use of resources, please consider
#  running the pipeline as a series of jobs (chain-jobs).

This is quite a busy job-script (and also inefficient on resources!). It runs through a number of steps, but some of those steps will utilise parallelisation via threading, and use the slurm environment variable SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK to inform the application(s) of the correct number of threads.

But why is this job inefficient on resources? This particular job involves a number of steps: some utilising parallelisation, and some not; some memory-hungry, others not. The problem with this is that the job has allocated to it a set amount of resources (compute and memory), which is allocated to it for the lifetime of the job. But only at certain times in this job are the resources requested fully utilised. At all other times this job is running, the resources are allocated, but not used, and therefore making those resources unavailable to other jobs. This has a knock-on effect of increasing queue-times, and leaves expensive resources idle.

A much more efficient way of running the same pipeline is to chain the job - split the pipeline into component parts and submit separate jobs for each of those parts. Each section of the pipeline (having its own job-script) is then free to allocate resources specific to that section of the pipeline. In the slurm world this is called job chaining, and has been exemplified in the next section using the same pipeline.

## Job Chains and Job Dependency

Chaining jobs is a method of sequentially running dependent jobs. Our chain-job example is a pipeline of 6 separate job scripts, based on the blast+ pipeline of the previous section. We do not show the full six job-scripts here for brevity, but are available on the gomphus cluster under /mnt/clusters/sponsa/data/classdata/Bioinformatics/REFS/slurm/slurm_examples/example4_chain.

Slurm has an option -d or --dependency that allows to specify that a job is only permitted to start if another job finished successfully.

In the folder (gomphus cluster) /mnt/clusters/sponsa/data/classdata/Bioinformatics/REFS/slurm/slurm_examples/example4_chain there are 6 separate job-scripts that need to be executed in a certain order. They are numbered in the correct pipeline order:

```{bash}
[user@gomphus ~]$ tree  /mnt/clusters/sponsa/data/classdata/Bioinformatics/REFS/slurm/slurm_examples/example4_chain
/mnt/clusters/sponsa/data/classdata/Bioinformatics/REFS/slurm/slurm_examples/example4_chain
├── example4_chain-step1.sh
├── example4_chain-step2.sh
├── example4_chain-step3.sh
├── example4_chain-step4.sh
├── example4_chain-step5.sh
├── example4_chain-step6.sh
├── example4_submit_all.sh
├── mouse38_cdna.fa
├── Mus_musculus.GRCm38.cdna.all.fa
├── Pfam-A.hmm
├── pipeline1.sh
├── Trinotate.sqlite
└── uniprot_sprot.trinotate_v2.0.pep

0 directories, 13 files
```

Each job is (importantly) commonly named using #SBATCH --job-name within each job-script. Also within this folder is a simple script (example4_submit_all.sh) that will execute the sbatch command on each of the job-scripts in the correct order:

```{bash}
#!/bin/bash:

for c in /mnt/clusters/sponsa/data/classdata/Bioinformatics/REFS/slurm/slurm_examples/example4_chain/example4_chain-step?.sh ;
do
 sbatch -d singleton $c
done
```

This sbatch command uses the -d singleton flag to notify slurm of the job-dependencies (all jobs must have the name job name defined by `#SBATCH --job-name [some constant name]`. At which point each submitted job will be forced to depend on successful completion of any previous job submitted by the same user, and with the same job-name. The full pipeline of 6 jobs will now run to completion, with no further user-intervention, making efficient use of the available resources.
